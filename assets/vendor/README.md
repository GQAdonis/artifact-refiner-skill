# Vendor Runtime Assets

This folder stores optional local browser runtime dependencies used by preview rendering.

Current expected file:

- `htmx.min.js` — local HTMX runtime used by offline-first preview rendering

If you need full HTMX behavior in previews, replace the placeholder `htmx.min.js` with the official distribution file from [htmx.org](https://htmx.org/).
